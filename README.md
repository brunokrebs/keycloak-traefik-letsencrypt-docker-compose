# Keycloak with Let's Encrypt Using Docker Compose

üìô The complete installation guide is available on my [website](https://www.heyvaldemar.com/install-keycloak-using-docker-compose/).

‚ùó Change variables in the `.env` to meet your requirements.

üí° Note that the `.env` file should be in the same directory as `keycloak-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose.yml`.

Create networks for your services before deploying the configuration using the commands:

`docker network create traefik-network`

`docker network create keycloak-network`

Deploy Keycloak using Docker Compose:

`docker compose -f keycloak-traefik-letsencrypt-docker-compose.yml -p keycloak up -d`

# keycloak-restore-database.sh Description

This script facilitates the restoration of a database backup:

1. **Identify Containers**: It first identifies the service and backups containers by name, finding the appropriate container IDs.

2. **List Backups**: Displays all available database backups located at the specified backup path.

3. **Select Backup**: Prompts the user to copy and paste the desired backup name from the list to restore the database.

4. **Stop Service**: Temporarily stops the service to ensure data consistency during restoration.

5. **Restore Database**: Executes a sequence of commands to drop the current database, create a new one, and restore it from the selected compressed backup file.

6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the restoration is completed.

To make the `keycloak-restore-database.shh` script executable, run the following command:

`chmod +x keycloak-restore-database.sh`

Usage of this script ensures a controlled and guided process to restore the database from an existing backup.
